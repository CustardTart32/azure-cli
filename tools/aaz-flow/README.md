## AAZ Flow
AAZ Flow is the MCP server for the AAZ APIs, enabling pruning of command-line interfaces, implementing custom logic, generating test cases, and more.

Please note that AAZ Flow is currently in early development. The functionality and available tools are subject to change and expansion as we continue to develop and improve the server.

### Tools
You can easily start the MCP server within your codespace environment:

Please setup your Copilot to use the AI features (**Ctrl** + **Alt** + **I** to open a chat):

After that, set the mode to `Agent` and the model to `Claude Sonnet`. The following is the use case of the tools:
1. "generate test for chaos module" to generate test cases in _chaos_ module.
2. "generate code for azure cli" to generate models AND codes.
